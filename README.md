###How to Use

Everything should be pretty straightforward except for perhaps the [vundles](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) in my vimrc that look like
```
Plugin 'githubUserName/repo'
```
This, however, is where a lot of the magic happens

All of the directories in .vim/bundles/ are empty because they are populated with vundle

###Salt

Everything in this repo is managed with salt here
